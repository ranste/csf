Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-Content:
0.43029262963 - sample 1
0.451051333333 - sample 2
0.646864112524 - sample 3
0.347852341166 - sample 4
0.263157894737 - sample 5
0.491518518519 - sample 6

Problem 3:

The problem that the program had was the variable linenum being undefined when
it tried to incriment on itself. The error line was linenum = linenum + 1.

Removing gc_count = 0 produces the same error when gc_count tries to incriment
on itself.

Problem 4:

Collaboration:

Worked alone

Reflection:

I learned how to run a program through the command line.
I wish I had known that pressing up would show the previous commands to speed up
running the six samples.
Advice for future students, don't be afraid to copy lines of code that are already
functioning.
